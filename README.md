# Neural Network 
 
Here, I have implemented how neural network works on stock market dataset using pytorch. I divide the full implementation into 3 parts and a pre-processing part. In first part, I have just worked with basic row code using numpy. In second part, I have tried to explore the working criteria of neural network, how backpropagation actually works and how gradient updated weight and bias. I have attached a a simple neural network image which I have implemented.
Before jumping into my main pytorch implementation, I have worked with simple dhaka stock exchange dataset for building my base stronger in pre-processing! I have learned many terms during do this pre-processing.

Finally I have implemented a fully connected neural network by using pytorch ! I have worked with different optimizers such as Adam, RMSprop, SGD. 
# 1)design model (input, output size, forward pass)
# 2) construct loss and optimizer
# 3) training loop
# - forward pass: compute prediction
# - backward pass: gradients
# - update weights
# - k-fold

Anyone can collect the dataset from yahoo finance ! Link : https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5Enya/history?ltr=1 (Nasdaq Futures)
Apart from this , for exploring pre-processing I have used another dataset which I have collected from Dhaka Stock Exchange !

Basically it's true that neural network never do well performance on stock data! But it really does not matter that your model do well or not on stock dataset, Your target will explore stock dataset on neural network . I can ensure you that you will learn a lots from exploring this work !!

Special note: I have attached some documents and text for anyone's better understanding on my coding file !
